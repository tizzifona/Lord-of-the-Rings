# üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Lord of the Rings ‚Äî OOP in Java

This educational Java project demonstrates the core principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** using characters and creatures from *The Lord of the Rings* universe. It is designed for beginners who are learning abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces in Java.

## üìå Project Objectives

- Understand and apply OOP fundamentals.
- Create a class hierarchy representing Tolkien's characters.
- Demonstrate polymorphism and interface implementation.
- Practice encapsulation using getters/setters.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Language:** ![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-%23ED8B00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=openjdk&logoColor=white)
- **IDE:** ![IntelliJ IDEA](https://img.shields.io/badge/IntelliJIDEA-000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=intellij-idea&logoColor=white)
- **Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming

## üß† OOP Concepts Demonstrated

| Principle      | Example                        |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| Abstraction     | `Character` as an abstract class |
| Inheritance     | `Elf`, `Human`, etc. extend `Character` |
| Encapsulation   | Private fields + getters/setters |
| Polymorphism    | Overridden `speak()` and `attack()` methods |
| Interface       | `Fighter` with `attack()` method |
